# Programmable Colloidal Particles Simulator
This repository presents codes written by Hidenori Tanaka for
H. Tanaka, Z. Zeravcic, M.P. Brenner “Mutation at Expanding Front of Self-Replicating Colloidal Clusters.”  
Physical Review Letters, 117, 238004, (2016).

Codes written in C for molecular dynamics simulation of Brownian particles with programmable "specific" and "dynamic" inter-particle interactions. (e.g. DNA colloids) You can assign distinct "species" for each particle and define "interaction matrix" to characterize time-dependent inter-particle interactions among them. 

Rapid developments in DNA nanotechnology opened up the new paradigm of "programmable materials" in nano/micron scales. 


Thus, this highly efficient code allowed us to conduct the first study of "evolutionary dynamics" of artificial self-replicating materials.
